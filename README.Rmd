<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of missing.values is to count the number of missing values from each column of a dataset grouped by one column.

## Installation

You can install the development version of missing.values like so:
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2023/missing.values")

```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(missing.values)
#This example computes the number of missing values in the `penguins` dataset grouped by the 'species'
library(palmerpenguins)
count_all_missing_by_group(penguins, species)
```
